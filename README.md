# CompactBib
A workaround to get a very compact â€¢ separated Latex bibliography. Latex wizardry framework for the pseudobib.tex file found here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/165000/condense-non-numbered-bibliography-into-one-line

Usage:
This requires the python package [bibtexparser](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io).
Like compiling a normal bibtex file, you first add the citations to both the .tex and .bib files.
Then, run
> python3 bib_to_pseudobib.py mwe.tex mwe.bib
> 
This will generate pseudobib.tex. Now, instead of calling \bibliography{mwe.bib}, we call \input{pseudobib}. 
Your tex file should now compile with the bibliography as normal (compile twice as usual to link the \cite commands to the updated bibliography)!

Note:
If `bib_to_pseudobib.py` runs in an error that involves the `journal_mapping` dictionary, it is likely due to a bibtex entry with a `journal` field not covered by that dictionary. You may solve that by adding manually the appropriate item to that dictionary definition in [`bib_to_pseudobib.py`](https://github.com/ekadofong/CompactBib/blob/main/bib_to_pseudobib.py).
